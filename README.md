## **Purpose**

CASA is a self-organized and autonomous alliance of crypto-blockchain developers and enthusiasts. Its aim to create standards which support interoperability and facilitate communication between blockchain protocols, software and companies.

CASA organizes working groups where proposals are debated, drafted and submitted as CAIPs for the purpose implementation and community adoption.

## **Organizational Structure**

CASA participants are structured into three groups:

| Role           | Description                                                                                     |
| :------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Members        | All participants. Expected to participate in working groups.                                    |
| Working Groups | Collections of members tackling specific areas of interest.                                     |
| Maintainers    | Members running CASA meetings (excluding working group) and ensuring overall process integrity. |

## **Meetings**

### **CASA Meetings**

All CASA stakeholders are invited to join a meeting every six weeks (attendance optional), for the purpose of:

- Sharing progress in individual working groups
- Proposing the creation of new working groups
- Evaluating CAIPs

Since CASA meetings are primarily intended to sharing the working groups' progress, at least one member from each active working group is expected to attend.

### **Working Group Meetings**

CASA members self-organize into topic-specific working groups. Individual working groups set their own meeting schedule and communicate in designated communication channels. We expect working groups to meet frequently enough to share their progress at CASA meetings.

The CASA meetings note template may help keep stakeholders aligned.
